Theater-Based Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND PURPOSE

This weeks project was largely focused on how to preform an analysis on theater based crowdfunding campaigns were we took the Kickstarter data and broke it down into many different parts to unfold what Louise was looking for. The spread sheet at hand was filled with campaigns from 2010 through 2017 where we are able to see the successful, failed, cancelled and live campaigns of a large range of categories. Due to the fact Louise was focusing towards theater campaigns we were able to grab all the data that was needed. The main tool used was Microsoft Excel where pivot tables, data charts, a handful of formulas were used to break down the data set.


ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES

Throughout this analysis one of the main functions used are pivot tables. Pivot tables are very resourceful and it is a great way to see large data sheets condensed into what you are truly looking for. With that being said don't let these pivot tables fool you, they can be hard to work with. When you are new to Pivot tables it is easy to get confused on which data goes into the values, columns, rows and filter categories. Sometimes when you put things in the wrong spots your data will look correct when it really isn't, so you will need to go over your work and get familiar with what your purpose with conducting a pivot table really is.
